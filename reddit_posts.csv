1gl2ros,liberal,MarquisEXB,When can we talk about the 12M-15M people who voted for Biden and didn't vote for Hillary or Harris as being due to sexism/unconscious bias?,"Trump had nearly the same amount of votes (72M in 2024 so far, 74M in 2020), while Hillary (66M in 2016) and Kamala (67M in 2024) both underperformed from Biden's win (81M in 2020). It seems highly unlikely that both the turnout overall was lower AND Trump converted people from D to R. So the loss was due to a lack of enthusiasm on the Democratic side. I know people will say it's the Comey effect for Hillary and try to lump the economy/immigration/LGBTQ rights for Harris. But that seems to be less likely given the enthusiasm bump she should have gotten from Trump's campaign antics, Roe v Wade, replacing Biden, a great VP pick, etc.

Can we just admit that a good portion of this is to be due to their gender?

And I know some people will state reasons why they didn't like her. Hillary was ""unlikeable"" and people are saying that Kamala ""didn't connect with me"", but both of those are subjective and likely due to unconscious sexism. People didn't have to say ""I'll never vote for a woman"" for it to be sexism. They could just find reasons that they didn't like Hillary/Harris that they wouldn't have found if they were men.

On to the drama. I was in the registrar's office for maybe a total of 4 minutes. It was really fast. As I'm putting my ballot into the machine, a guy walks through the door behind me. They try pointing him to where he needs to go and he says loudly, ""I'm not here to vote. I'm here to get a vote count.""

\- Severely weakened the global fight against climate change. Thought Helene was bad? You've doomed your fellow Americans to increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, floods, wild fires and other extreme weather. The same goes for vulnerable countries and regions across the world. This will get worse every year, until large swathes of the US (and the world) will become inhabitable.

\- Betrayed your daughters, wives and mothers, as the GOP will strip away women's rights step by step. Same goes for any other minority in the US.

\- Very likely started a global economic war. If Trump goes ahead with his plans to put tariffs on everything, this will exacerbate a global economic war. It will increase inflation, likely increase interest rates globally, increase unemployment. You probably didn't know, but the Great Depression was caused by economic isolationism and tariffs.

\- Killed or critically wounded NATO. No European ally will trust the US from this point. We're on our own, and so are you.

\- Possibly doomed Ukraine to become a Russian vassal state. You probably don't care, because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines Europe, which used to be your main allies, friends and trade partners.

\- Doomed Palestinians to an even worse genocide. The tragedy of this choice by third party candidate voters is bottomless.

\- Significantly exacerbated the decline and potential death of US democracy.

You did this because you are uninformed/misinformed, extremely cynical or just dumb. There is no excuse for what you have done, every man and woman has a responsibility to learn and understand, in order to employ your vote in the best possible way for your fellow human beings, and nature. You failed that horribly.

I don't know about you, but if my wife, who is always glad to have a kiss or hug were to back away when I tried to, even with all our familiarity, my reaction would be to stop. I might be a little confused and wonder why, just since she is usually fine with it. But my reflexive response certainly wouldn't be to move forward more and kiss her anyway. Even less if it was a date with someone, and even far less if it was a kid I didn't know. Really it's kind of weird trying to kiss someone else's kid in the first place.

Who's ready to join for the first time?","m 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life. Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered.

But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said.

So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

    volunteering with me in some way shape or form

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

I'll go first:  they can no longer get health insurance for their pre-existing conditions because Trump repealed the Affordable Care Act.  Or, they or their son is on the hook for 18 years of child support because they knocked up their girlfriend and can no longer get an abortion.  Or, they don't have any grandchildren because their daughter can't get IVF.  What are some other ones?",1730914737.0,123,217

-A secure border
- An end to funding wars 
-The protection of human life at all stages from from conception to natural death
- The protection of children from a billion dollar industry that wants to mutilate their bodies before they turn 18
- The protection of femboys and Tom boys who would grow up in any other age to just be gay or gender non conforming
- The right to 100% free speech - freedom of speech IS freedom from consequences from the government 
- The right to have the first female  president win because she is better than any man in power - not because she is a DEI
- The protection of women from men invading their spaces
- The protection from the state forcing a sh0t onto me
- The protection of my religion (Christianity) from an atheist death cult 
- The protection of ill√©gal migrant children and innocent refugees (make them citizens, not slaves)
- The continued criminalization of mind altering drugs 
- The protection from sterilizing children who aren‚Äôt trusted to drink or vote or get a tattoo, but for some reason can destroy their bodies 
- The right to ‚Äújust be gay‚Äù 
- The protection from erasure of the homosexual and lesbian communities by the alphabet mafia who seek to redefine what gay is 
- The protection from transgender people from military service 

Trump didn‚Äôt get rid of gay marriage back in 2016, when he had a Republican super majority. He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting. So if you‚Äôre voting today (which I beg you to do) because you ‚Äúcare about the interests‚Äù of your gay friends and family?

1eb67l0,Republican,Dope_Reddit_Guy,I will be switching my vote to Donald Trump this election,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been here a little bit in the past but just wanted to say I am proud to say I am voting Trump this November. 

I decided this about a month or so ago. I‚Äôve usually voted 3rd party/libertarian candidates in the past, I voted Jo Jorgensen in 2020 and realized that this is not doing me or our country any good. As much as RFK Jr could be a good candidate he‚Äôs not going to win more than likely. 

I grew up in the south, have lived in liberal cities, lived in red states and blue states, currently live in a liberal city. I‚Äôve noticed that Biden/Harris don‚Äôt care about helping build up lower income communities and instead it‚Äôs all about hand outs, it‚Äôs not about building them up as people, giving them places to work, job skills, and helping get people on their feet. It‚Äôs about keeping them down so they rely on them and will vote for them every election cycle, but the kicker is every 3/3.5 years is when democrats rediscover these communities and pander to them. I‚Äôm sick and tired of seeing it as someone who lives near these communities. I want to see these people grow and flourish and make something of themselves, but instead I see the people who are actually getting legit help from the government are not even legal citizens here as we saw in Chicago/New York/Texas/California.

I‚Äôm tired of the democrats only caring about people specifically every election cycle and getting hardly anything done in between. 

In terms of Trump, while he‚Äôs not my favorite person, I think he‚Äôs better than Kamala Harris. I feel that his policies will help the population far more than Kamala Harris.

With Trumps legal history that we all know about, I think the justice system is highly against him for political reasons, I think he‚Äôs a manufactured felon and not an actual felon, I think Alvin Bragg and the DOJ took a weird misdemeanor and bumped it up to 34 felony counts. This is the same DA in NYC who‚Äôs taken violent felons and lowered them to misdemeanors. I believe he is being weaponized and it‚Äôs all to keep him out of office and I can see right through that and I hope you all can as well.

Joe Biden has taken classified information and been given a slap on the wrist, Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence and was given a slap on the wrist. I think Trump can be given a slap on the wrist and given a pass like the other 2.

I also don‚Äôt believe the whole project 2025 narrative they‚Äôre trying to create, this is a foundation that‚Äôs been trying to push a hard right agenda for decades and they‚Äôve never been successful and they‚Äôre not going to be successful with Trump now. Pay attention to his offical agenda, Agenda47.

When there was the assassination attempt, I saw Trump put his fist in the air and tell people to fight for what they believe in, and I think we should fight for a better America for all Americans.

At the end of the day, I do not want a SF progressive as a president. I think Trump will be better at keeping us safe, helping our economy grow, bringing higher wages back to our workers in this country, and helping get the US back to where it belongs. He‚Äôll be better for all groups of people and help everyone grow consistently. I think Trumps strong stances are what we need for the country and that‚Äôs a strong border, strong economy, ending wars overseas and negotiating peace deals. I believe he will win but keep spreading the word. 


Btw, my family all live in a very competitive swing state and I am making sure they vote Trump as well. 

Thank you all for reading.


P.S I hope this post changes your mind too, if this post has inspired you please message me! I‚Äôm hoping to change at least one persons mind to vote the other way!",1721839579.0,665,220

I am a first generation American. I'm in love with the idea of the American dream. I feel as if my life is molded around it. Along with all the ups and downs, and boy my life has been one hellride so far, I wouldn't be the same without this dream. I see myself becoming who I want to be and I am obtaining tangibles and intangibles that I never would've had I not worked this hard.

Many see Trump as a villain. This guy is a new York made man. An example to look up to. I believe he is a true protector of the American dream. He could've taken whatever money he was inherited and fumbled. He could've went to the Colonial inn and drank it all away. To me, he should be an idol to all Americans, especially young. However mainstream stereotypes seem very true, my generation (I'm 26) is lazy and wants handouts for everything. Free water, free healthcare, free is not always free. 

Kamala is going to tax hard working Americans. I know that I am not alone when I say I don't want to be taxed more because people can't find it in themselves to be diligent and make something of themselves. If, and I can't believe I'm saying if, Kamala wins, we are doomed and the American Dream will certainly become a nightmare. ",1723581174.0,599,576

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term ‚Äî chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

2nd pic: However, with the run Trump has been on the past two weeks, all he needs is Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina to seal it.

So essentially, even if they found a way to flip Arizona (1.5% Trump lead), take Nevada (Deadlock), Wisconsin (Deadlock), and Michigan (Deadlock), it still wouldn't be enough.

Pennsylvania is looking like the big one, folks, and Trump has serged in every battleground state since Kamala's Fox News interview. Obviously it isn't over if he doesn't take Pennsylvania and any state can swing in theory, but that would be the clearest path to victory.

I'm honestly starting to see the dangers and craziness of honestly both political parties. There are extremists on both sides, however, it seems that there a majority of republicans who just want to do the right thing. While the democratic party is increasingly getting crazier. I remember when CNN was actually one of the more honest networks you could watch. Now, it is so biased etc. I could imagine myself saying some of this shit a few years ago. Do I believe in legitimate cases of Transgender people? Absolutely. Do I believe that it is now becoming a trend and that ""Gender Identity"" is being forced down childrens throats. Fucking absolutely. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being LGBTQ+. But, allowing parents to grossly modify their children... based on feelings they have... that may just be due to imbalanced hormones due to growing... is absolutely fucking disgusting and should be prosecuted imho. It kind of has solidified my core beliefs and has me thinking about switching to the Republican party. Just wow...

I have been a far left democrat, and I believe it has something to do with the group of people around me. I feel like I was forced to believe in things, that legitimately have no evidence or are based on just emotion. What is happening to this country? 

On another note, whatever happened to civil conversation between parties. I remember when being a Republican / Democrat wasn't such a big issue. Sure we disagreed on some core principles, but we never were neck & neck. Just... wow.

As a Black conservative, I've often found myself in situations where I'm labeled as ""racist against my own kind"" or even accused of hating Black people. It's a tough thing to grapple with because nothing could be further from the truth. I love my community and take pride in my heritage, but I also have my own beliefs and principles that don't always align with what others expect.

For instance, just because I don't agree with everything Obama did or I'm not a fan of Kamala Harris, it doesn't mean I hate them‚Äîor Black people in general. I respect them as leaders, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to support everything they stand for. My values are what guide my choices, and sometimes those choices don't fit neatly into the expectations others have for me as a Black man.

I'm curious‚Äîare there others out there who feel the same? How do you deal with the backlash and accusations that come from simply having a different perspective? How do you stay true to yourself in the face of these challenges? Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's gone through something similar.",1724849976.0,306,83

They loved America and the fact that they were able to come from nothing and build a brand new life for their family should be a testament to how great our country has been, can be, and will be again.

1gj4691,Conservative,mrjesusnohere,I‚Äôm an NYC democrat and I voted for Trump today. ,"The Trump derangement syndrome was truly real with me in 2016- I spent the entire day after the election in bed, hungover and crying. I thought our country was over, I was terrified for the safety of my Jewish husband, and I was telling my gay friends to get married in case their marriage rights were stripped during Trump‚Äôs administration. 

But in 2020 I started to rethink things. Me and 8 million other New Yorkers were confined to our tiny apartments indefinitely. We had cops driving cars through our parks, telling people to sit 6 feet away from each other, while my peers praised their ‚ÄúDaddy Cuomo‚Äù for doing what they viewed Trump wasn‚Äôt willing to do. I watched protestors tear up our city- many of the same people who professed their loved for ‚ÄúDaddy Cuomo‚Äù- saying the actions of the protestors were just because the existential threat of systemic racism was far greater than the risk of Covid. I watched those same people dance in the streets when Biden won the election. Meanwhile, I had been laid off twice at that point in 2020 because of crowd restrictions in public places, and was another month away from being laid off for a third time because of the spike of Covid cases in December of 2020. 

Since Biden has been elected and since his first magic trick of giving us all $1200 and then devaluing all our money by 2-3%, life here in NYC has steadily declined. I know people assaulted in the streets and on the subway. Our mayor has indicted for corruption. I grocery shop at Walmart in NJ because even the lowest quality foods in the city are ridiculously expensive. It‚Äôs $20 for a cocktail around here these days. A friend of mine who opened a business here  18 months ago expected to spend $200k to flip the space, build inventory, and hire staff ended up spending $1m instead because of inflation. Meanwhile we have immigrants who came here because they wanted over the last 4 years living in Midtown Manhattan hotels- where any average New Yorker would have to pay $4-6k a month, having their groceries paid for or complaining when their free food isn‚Äôt good enough. We have children who are graduating high school without basic reading and mathematical skills despite our school district spending $21,000 on every student per year. 

Meanwhile we are being told constantly by left leaning media that the economy has never been better. We were told Biden was sprightly and ready for four more years even though we could all see with our eyes he was deteriorating. Kamala was heavily disliked amongst my fellow liberals on July 20th but was now the hero everyone was asking for on July 21st. Now as she‚Äôs campaigning she‚Äôs telling people we can‚Äôt have four more years of this and my colleagues nod and yassify her- even though we all know the last four years WERE HER. How am I the only person amongst the Democrats I know who sees this? 

Enough is enough of the gaslighting by the legacy media and I‚Äôm fed up with being told to not trust my own eyes. I‚Äôm sick of being told by celebrities who to vote for, while they released that insipid ‚ÄúImagine‚Äù video they made during 2020 from the comfort of their Malibu estates while I and many others were on the phone with unemployment for hours, making sure we could get money so we didn‚Äôt lose our homes during a global pandemic.   I hope that many other liberals this year will see how we‚Äôve been played and will attempt to stop the cycle, like me.

1gf063g,Conservative,Any-Air1439,I went to the Trump rally at MSG! Sharing my experience and take aways! ‚úäÔ∏èüá∫üá≤,"Im a minority women, a catholic, and lifelong conservative who currently lives in Manhattan. I went to see President Trump at MSG on Sunday. It was my first political rally/event of any kind. Here are some of my observations and take aways if you're interested so you dont have to rely on the media (sorry its long)!

First and foremost WOW! Omgggg the turnout! I severely underestimated his level of support here. I figured i could leave an hour before and walk in to get a seat. No, lol. When I registered for tickets it said the event started at 7, I planned on leaving at 6. So at 445 when i see an article that trump takes the stage at 5, i jump off the couch and skeedaddle over. Luckily i live close to msg. I bought a cute hat and sweatshirt to wear. First time in my life ive worn anything remotely political, but i thought it was important to show that there are full on supporters and not just rally observers in nyc. Also a note that the crowd greatly filled in for a good 2 hours after me. I think the 7pm messaging kept a lot of ppl including me from coming earlier.

I arrive at 515pm. Theres hundreds of cops as the streets outside msg are blocked off. An officer tells me they stopped letting ppl into msg a long time ago, but there are multiple sectioned off areas outside where we can watch on a screen. So i head to the closest area. Tulsi Gabbard is speaking (love her and her evolution ü§ç). I join the crush of people and after an hour im able to scooch all the way up to the corner of 7th/fashion ave. Its PAKCED. You cant move, crammed in. People around me talked about getting in line 4, 5, 6 hours early and still not getting inside. Then i found out some people showed up the night before and camped out! 

Had it not been for the ppl in the crowd i would have just gone home. Bc the screen was blocked by a tree (multiple crowd chants to MOVE THAT TREE lol) and you could hardly hear a thing (except dana whiteüòÜ). Many ppl watching along on their phone for volume. But the vibe was unmatched. Hard to describe. So much enthusiasm. All creeds/colors. Everyone chatting and joking with the ppl around them. In front of me a boomer teamster chatting with a young arab kid draped in an American flag and his mom, and he joked with a gen z hispanic supporter on his other side the rest of the night. Multiply by 100. Everyone was just happy. It was a super communal atmosphere. Cheesy but true. Multiple comments about anger and outrage not being present here. Also the weather was really nice.

For the first half the crowd was about an even 50/50 split- half white half various shades of black and brown. DO NOT let anyone tell you minorities hate trump. Harris might take more of the overall minority vote than trump but i think we'll see the highest recorded numbers of minorities voting for trump than any other republican candidate in history. Same with the overall NYC and NY vote counts. Surprising to me were the insanely high numbers of orthodox and non orthodox jews. Even jewish people were talking about it. When i arrived id say at least, at least 20% of the crowd was outwardly jewish meaning identifiable dress or adornments, so the actual number was likely way higher. Also very surprising to me were the number of arab supporters. Saw palestine for trump signs. I didnt expect to see that. For the first time ever i saw a significant number of east asians in trump gear. Mostly men but a few women came with them. Also shocking the number of EASL chinese immigrants who showed up. All aged 50s+. Under represented were indian people. I saw a couple young guys in maga hats who looked like your average crypto bros. Saw 0 indian women. Also slightly underrepresented imo given the location...hispanics. Im told lots of hispanic supporters inside but outside the jewish supporters easily outnumbered hispanic by a large margin. At least where i was standing, but it didnt look different when i had to walk through the crowd to leave. To note the jewish orthodox supporters left early, many did not stay through the log jam of speakers, but I can confirm they were there early and in huge numbers. Black men showed up for trump, but I only saw 3 black women. The crowd was about 60-70% millennial/gen z aka under 40 with significant gen z representation. I saw 1 child. About a 60/40 split of men/women. I asked everyone around me where they were from. Was pleasantly surprised it was mostly the 5 boroughs. 2nd after that was LI. One guy came down from Boston.  I didnt meet anyone from NJ which I thought i would have.

There was only 1 agitator in the crowd. I think white guy with a small sign that simply said ""34 convictions"". He got a couples laughs and boos, but it was all very lighthearted and jokey. No one was aggressive, rude, or vulgar with him and he stayed longer than i did lol.

I stayed for 3.5 hours. My phone died otherwise i probably would have stayed until trump finished speaking even though i couldnt hear him. Im really glad i got to experience a rally. I would absolutely go again, and I would go early to try and get a seat. Chatting with a couple other attendees we discussed how no other politician from any party could draw such a crowd and amount of enthusiasm like this in nyc. Not a single one. Love him or hate him, trump has the IT factor and ppl show up to witness it. 

Lastly I'll end with snippets of my convos and those around me. Gave me a really interesting perspective on why people from such different backgrounds showed up and are voting for trump.

Man, chinese, 50s-ish, EASL Queens- 
>biden voter but ""kamala is just too far left"". However hes greatly concerned about tariffs as tariffs ""raise prices"" and ""theyre very hard to remove once theyre in place""

Gen z arab american LI- 
>""i was always liberal until i did my own research. One of my friends is super liberal now every time i go over to her house shes mad at me""

Jewish lady 50s Brooklyn- 
>appalled at bidens stance on gaza and also appalled at the abandonment of hurricane helene victims by the federal govt

Many first time jewish trump voters discussing the obvious reason: 
>Gaza/anti semitism. And again i really need to drive home not only the presence of jewish voters but the ENTHUSIASM they had. Most around me were livestreaming their attendance. 

Black gen z son and his black probably gen x father-
>""HELL YEA we love trump""   

Two very young jewish girls behind me about 18-21ish Brooklyn (so young i had to explain to them who hulk hogan was lol)- 
>""i just said i dont want to marry anyone super political and now here i am at a trump rally"" as they erupted in giggles"" üòÇüíô

White guy 50s queens- 
>""we just want even tariffs"" also said ""why not give him a shot cant be worse than what we just had""

Discussion between multiple gen z/millenial asian and hispanic men and 1 black man (bronx/manhattan/possibly other boroughs)-
>about how no one voted for her and how you dont deserve to be the pres nominee on a ticket if youve never won a primary and how tulsi gabbard ended her last pres bid over marijuana.

Gen z hispanic kid Manhattan- 
>""if she wins this country is cooked""


I know theres more but honestly im forgetting already bc it happened on sun. Oh and i was only heckled once. When i left i was waiting at the light to cross. This lady next to me was staring, i thought for a cab. Nope, at my hat. She was like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. Then she went off about it isnt worth it, my life, my rights, hes a fascist, i cant believe it etc etc... I actually felt bad for her, she sincerely sounded distraught. I just told her things would be ok then kept moving. Honestly though, im not sure shes ok.

Enjoy some pics and videos of my view and ps thats me in the TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING hat. Covered my face tho bc reddit is unhinged lmao üíÄ

Guys, if im lying im dying! If you get the opportunity to attend a rally, i highly suggest it. It was fun, positive, and i left feeling really hopeful ‚ù§üá∫üá≤

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence.

1gc5ga6,Conservative,Muted_Leader_327,Proud to cast my first ballot for President Trump,"Not sure why I'm making this post, just wanted to share with someone as my family is pissed I'm voting the way I am. 

I am a Hindu from India (immigrated when I was very young and joined the US Army to serve the country).  Today, I cast my ballot for the first time, and I was proud to vote for President Trump, despite the fact that everyone I know is telling me it's an awful, crazy thing to do. The reason is because the values Trump supports (family, pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, etc) are all in line with orthodox Hindu values. Furthermore, Trump cut funding for Pakistan, which has launched countless terrorist attacks, and even an ethnic cleansing campaign, against Hindus and Sikhs. 

By contrast, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have ties to radical islamists and Harris and Biden gave millions to Pakistan so that they could build more fighter jets. This is absolutely disgusting, and I am so glad that I am able to do at least a little bit to stop them from reaching the levers of power.

I apologize for this rant, I just wanted to express my pride and reasons for voting the way I did, as everyone in my family is pissed at me for voting this way lol.",1729892260.0,1702,207
